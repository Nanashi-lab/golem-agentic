# golem-agentic

golem-agentic allows you to write AI agents and non-agentic workers in golem with zero knowledge in WIT.

**Designed with AI in mind:** dynamic agent and method discovery, plus plug‑and‑play support for MCP. The elements of AI here are first‑class citizens.

While dynamic in nature, interactions between agents are **type-safe.**

This is _**NOT**_ automatic WIT generation based on user code. This implies, we disallow leaking anything about WIT into user's development flow
